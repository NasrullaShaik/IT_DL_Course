Cloud services are categorized into layers of abstraction: IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS, along with other newer models.

### 2.1 IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
IaaS provides virtualized hardware resources over the internet. The user is responsible for operating systems, applications, and data, while the provider manages the physical infrastructure.

**Examples**: AWS EC2, Microsoft Azure VMs, Google Compute Engine
**Use Cases**:
    - Hosting websites or applications
    - Disaster recovery and backup
    - Testing and development environments

### 2.2 PaaS (Platform as a Service)
PaaS offers a platform allowing developers to build, test, and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure.

**Examples**: Google App Engine, Heroku, Azure App Services
**Use Cases**:
    - Application development
    - API integration
    - CI/CD automation pipelines

### 2.3 SaaS (Software as a Service)
SaaS delivers ready-to-use applications over the web. Users interact with the software, while the provider handles everything else.

**Examples**: Gmail, Microsoft 365, Salesforce
**Use Cases**:
    - Email and collaboration
    - CRM and ERP systems
    - File sharing and cloud storage

### 2.4 FaaS (Function as a Service) / Serverless
FaaS allows running discrete functions in response to events, without managing servers.

**Examples**: AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions
**Use Cases**:
    - Real-time data processing
    - Microservices backends
    - Event-based workflows

### 2.5 Other Models
- DBaaS (Database as a Service): Managed database services (e.g., Amazon RDS, Firebase).
- STaaS (Storage as a Service): Cloud-based file and object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Dropbox).
- CaaS (Container as a Service): Container orchestration and management (e.g., GKE, AKS).
